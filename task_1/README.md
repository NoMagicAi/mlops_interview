Here is a CSV file that will be a subject of an analysis during the interview.
Data exploration and analysis can be done with any tool, according to Candidates preferences.
Feel free to download and explore the file before the meeting if you feel it would be helpful for you, but it's also OK to do this during the meeting.

The task:
The capability of our robot to efficiently pick items depends on their characteristics, like weight,
shape and size. We want to know if there are some categories of items that are particularly difficult. 
Could you extract groups that should be handled better?
What would be the gain if we improved in this area?

Good luck! :)
